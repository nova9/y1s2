1. What is a pointer?

    A pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable as its value.

2. Describe the usage of pointers in C.

    Store and manage the addresses of dynamically allocated blocks of memory.

3. .

    1. What are the outputs of following program?

        30

    2. Consider a compiler where int takes 4 bytes, char takes 1 byte and pointer takes 4 bytes.

        sizeof arri[] = 12 \
        sizeof ptri = 4 \
        sizeof arrc[] = 3 \
        sizeof ptrc = 4

    3. (Assumption: float takes 4 bytes)

        90.5 \
        3

4. What is alinked list?

    A linked list consists of nodes where each node contains a data field and a reference(link) to the next node in the list.

5. What are the differences between Linear Array and Linked List?

    Arrays have random access.

    Elements in a linear array are stored in contiguous memory locations

    The size of a linear array is fixed at allocation time.
